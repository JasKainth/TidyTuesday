# TidyTuesday
Fun data visualizations using the TidyTuesday datasets 

In these files, I will post some of my data visualizations from the R for Data Science: TidyTuesday project.
All the datasets are from that project and can be accessed from this URL: https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday.  
There will also be the occasional machine learning model as well if the data is well suited for that!  
TidyTuesday is a weekly social data project that focusses on understanding how to summarize and arrange data to make meaningful plots using  ````dplyr```` , ````tidyr```` , ````ggplot2```` & other tools in the ````tidyverse```` universe. 

## Friends   
For this data, I looked at the ratings and viewers for the show. Also, later I examined the correlation among the emotions of utterance (line) in scenes and also the correlation among which *friends* were in scenes together.

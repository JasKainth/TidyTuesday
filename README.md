# TidyTuesday
Fun data visualizations using the TidyTuesday datasets 

In these files, I will post some of my data visualizations from the R for Data Science: TidyTuesday project.
All the datasets are from that project and can be accessed from this URL: https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday.  
There will also be the occasional machine learning model as well if the data is well suited for that!  
TidyTuesday is a weekly social data project that focusses on understanding how to summarize and arrange data to make meaningful plots using  ````dplyr```` , ````tidyr```` , ````ggplot2```` & other tools in the ````tidyverse```` universe.  
For each dataset, I will include a file with the code (.Rmd file) along with one plot which is used for the README file. The view the rest of the plots please run the code on your computer. 

## Friends (2020/ Week 37)
The data this week comes from ```friends```Â R package (https://github.com/EmilHvitfeldt/friends).  
Credit for code: Jas Kainth  
For this data, I looked at the ratings and viewers for the show. Also, later I examined the correlation among the emotions of utterance (line of dialogue) in scenes and also the correlation among which *friends* were in scenes together.  
The following is a plot that compares the episode rating to the average rating of the season.

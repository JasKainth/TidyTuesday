# TidyTuesday

## Summary

TidyTuesday is a weekly social data project that focusses on understanding how to summarize and arrange data to make meaningful plots using  ````dplyr```` , ````tidyr```` , ````ggplot2```` & other tools in the ````tidyverse```` universe.

For each dataset, we include a file with the code (.Rmd & .R file), which can be run using [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) or command line. See [How to Run](#how-to-run).

# How to Run  

## Dependencies

[Install R](https://cran.rstudio.com/)

## Run via Command Line

After installing R, you can run a script in terminal, like so:
```shell
R < european_energy/script.R --no-save
```

# Datasets

## European Energy Dataset  
The data comes from Eurostat (https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Electricity_generation_statistics_%E2%80%93_first_results)  

For this data, we explore the energy supplied and produced by the countries in the European Union. Also, we attempt to examine which countries are trying to be more green and also which types of energy is becoming more/less popular from a period of 2016 to 2018.  

The following map shows energy produced by the countries in Europe over 3 years, seperated by Renewable and Non-Renewable energy.

## Friends Dataset

This data comes from the ```friends```Â R package https://github.com/EmilHvitfeldt/friends.

For this data, we look at the ratings and viewers for the show. Also, later we examine the correlation among the emotions of utterance (line of dialogue) in scenes and also the correlation among which *friends* are in scenes together.

The following plot compares the episode rating to the average rating of the season.
